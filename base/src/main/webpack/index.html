      Thank you for choosing MechJackBot. Before you can start MechJackBot we
      need to make sure that we have some basic configuration completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below you will see the results of three configuration checks we are making
      to be sure your MechJackBot is ready to go. If any of them fail you'll be
      guided through a process to fix each problem, one at a time. At the end of
      each fix process you'll be brought back here to either fix the next
      problem or start using MechJackBot.
